#How to setup a vue project with webpack.#
First of all, this repo just to practice create vue and webpack boilerplate myself.
If you would link to know more detail please refer this link: https://dev.to/lavikara/setup-vue-webpack-and-babel-boo

This post gives a step by step guide to setting up vue.js using webpack. Youâ€™ll need to have node installed on your computer, youâ€™ll also need a basic knowledge of how vue works, and of course a code editor.
Below are Steps:
###Creating a folder and a package json file###
### 1. Installation of dependencies###
In your terminal, use the mkdir command to create a project folder and use the cd command to change directory into the folder created.
In the file you created, run the command `npm init â€“y` to create a `package.json` file
Now that we have a `package.json` file to keep track of our dependencies, we can go ahead to install them.
Dependencies: first we install vue, vue-router and core-js as dependencies. Run `npm install vue vue-router core-js --save` this would install the three packages as dependencies.
Dev-dependencies: Now we install webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server, babel-loader, @babel /core, @babel /preset-env, vue-loader, vue-template-compiler. 
Run `npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env vue-loader vue-template-compiler -D` this would install all these packages as dev-dependencies. 
Our package.json file should look like this after the installation process
```json
{
  "name": "vue-webpack-setup",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "core-js": "^3.6.5",
    "vue": "^2.6.12",
    "vue-router": "^3.4.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.11.6",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.11.5",
    "babel-loader": "^8.1.0",
    "vue-loader": "^15.9.3",
    "vue-template-compiler": "^2.6.12",
    "webpack": "^4.44.1",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.3.12",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.0"
  }
}
```
### 2. File/Folder structure###
Our folder structure would be similar to the default folder structure we get when using the vue cli to create a project. 
So lets create a public folder and an src folder in the root of our project. 
In the public folder, add a `favicon.ico` file and create an `index.html` file. 
In the `index.html` file, add this boilerplate
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>Vue app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <!-- built files will be auto injected -->
  </body>
</html>
```
In our src folder lets create an App.vue file and a `main.js` file.
N.B: `App.vue` file starts with a capital letter.
In our App.vue file, add this code
```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <div class="nav">
      <router-link to="/">Home</router-link>|<router-link to="/about"
        >About</router-link
      >
    </div>
    <router-view />
  </div>
</template>

<style lang="scss">
// @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300;400;500&display=swap");

// :root {
//   --font: Roboto, sans-serif;
//   --textColor: #374961;
//   --linkActiveColor: #41b783;
// }

// #app {
//   font-family: var(--font);
//   -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
//   -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
//   text-align: center;
//   color: var(--textColor);

//   .logo {
//     width: 20%;
//   }
// }

// .nav {
//   padding: 30px 0 100px 0;

//   a {
//     font-weight: 500;
//     color: var(--textColor);
//     margin: 0 5px;
//   }

//   a.router-link-exact-active {
//     color: var(--linkActiveColor);
//   }
// }
</style>
```
the scss style is commented out because we don't have a loader to process `.scss` files yet.

In our `main.js` file, add this code
```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import App from "./App.vue";
import router from "./router";

new Vue({
  router,
  render: (h) => h(App),
}).$mount("#app");
```
Now we create three folders in our src folder namely, assets, router, views. 
In the assets folder, lets add an image and call it `logo.png`. 
In the router folder, create an `index.js` file and add this code in the `index.js` file
```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import VueRouter from "vue-router";
import Home from "../views/Home.vue";

Vue.use(VueRouter);

const routes = [
  {
    path: "/",
    name: "Home",
    component: Home,
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    name: "About",
    component: () =>
      import(/* webpackChunkName: "about" */ "../views/About.vue"),
  },
];

const router = new VueRouter({
  mode: "history",
  routes,
});

export default router;
```
notice how we imported the about component in the router, this kind of import tells webpack to lazyload the about component.

In our views folder, lets create a file called `Home.vue.`
N.B: File names should start with capital letter.
Now, let's add this code in our `Home.vue` file
```vue
<template>
  <div id="home">
    <!-- <img class="logo" src="../assets/logo.png" alt="logo" /> -->

    <h1>ðŸ‘‹Hello worldðŸŒŽ</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```
the image is commented out because we don't have a loader to process such file yet.
then add this to our `About.vue` file
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>This is the about page</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```
### 3. Configure webpack to use babel loader, and vue loader###
Babel loader helps transpile ECMAScript 2015+ code into JavaScript that can be run by older JavaScript engines. While vue loader helps transform vue components into plain JavaScript module.

To configure webpack to use these loaders, we need to create two files namely, `babel.config.js`, and `webpack.config.js`.
In the `babel.config.js` file lets add this code
```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        useBuiltIns: "usage",
        corejs: 3,
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```
@babel /preset-env helps to detect browsers we want to support so babel loader knows how to go about transpiling our JavaScript code. 
we would need to add a browserslist option in our package.json file so babel knows what browsers we want to support. 
So in our `package.json` file, let's add
```json
"browserslist": [
    "Chrome >= 45",
    "Firefox ESR",
    "Edge >= 12",
    "Explorer >= 10",
    "iOS >= 9",
    "Safari >= 9",
    "Android >= 4.4",
    "Opera >= 30",
    "> 1%",
    "last 2 versions",
    "not dead"
  ]
```
Ideally you would want to compile as little code as possible, so support only relevant browsers. The useBuiltIns and corejs options are for polyfill imports, you can read more about it here.
In our `webpack.config.js` file lets add this code
```js
const { VueLoaderPlugin } = require("vue-loader");
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    main: "./src/main.js",
  },
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.vue$/,
        loader: "vue-loader",
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new VueLoaderPlugin(),
  ],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      vue$: "vue/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js",
    },
    extensions: ["*", ".js", ".vue", ".json"],
  },
};
```
From the code above we import VueLoaderPlugin from vue-loader and the path module which we will be using to configure our entry and output point so webpack will know where to start compiling from and where to put our compiled code after compiling. You can read more about VueLoaderPlugin here.

In the code above we see a module option where we define some rules, the first rule tells webpack to use babel loader to transpile all files having a .js extension excluding everything in the node_modules folder, while the second rule tells webpack to apply the vue loader to any file with a .vue extension.

The resolve option in the code above has an alias and extension key value pair, alias has a value which defines a vue alias and helps us import vue packages without using relative path, while extension has a value which tells webpack how to resolve imports and enables us import files without the extension, you can read more about it here.
### 4. Write scripts to start your server###
To see our setup work, weâ€™ll need to write scripts in our package.json file to run the webpack-dev-server. So go into the package.json file and add these to the scripts object.
```json
"build": "webpack --mode production",
"start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development"
```
Now we can go back to our terminal and run `npm run start` to start up webpack development server, our project should compile successfully else you can go through the steps again or drop a comment, Iâ€™ll be glad to help you out.

N.B: We won't be able to view our project in the browser yet because we haven't configured the htmlWebpackPlugin and webpack doesn't know where to insert our bundle files.
### 5. Loaders, Plugins, and Code Splitting###
Loaders and plugins are third-party extensions used in handling files with various extensions. Just like we used vue-loader to handling files with .vue extension, we have loaders and plugins for .scss files, .html files, images, etc.

Basically when you import/require files or modules, webpack tests the path against all loaders and passes the file to whichever loader passes the test. you can read more about loaders here

In this post, we will make use of file-loader, sass-loader, css-loader, style-loader, CleanWebpackPlugin, MiniCssExtractPlugin, htmlWebpackPlugin, autoprefixer. To install these loaders and plugin, we run npm install file-loader sass sass-loader css-loader style-loader postcss postcss-loader autoprefixer clean-webpack-plugin html-webpack-plugin mini-css-extract-plugin -D

file-loader: The file-loader is used to process files like images, videos, fonts. To use file-loader, insert this code into `webpack.config.js` file
```js
      {
        test: /\.(eot|ttf|woff|woff2)(\?\S*)?$/,
        loader: "file-loader",
        options: {
          name: "[name][contenthash:8].[ext]",
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|jpe?g|gif|webm|mp4|svg)$/,
        loader: "file-loader",
        options: {
          outputPath: "assets",
          esModule: false,
        },
      },
```
working with .css and .scss files: For webpack to correctly process .css and .scss files, the order in which you arrange loaders is important. first we need to import MiniCssExtractPlugin and autoprefixer in our webpack.config.js file like this
`const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require("mini-css-extract-plugin");`

`const autoprefixer = require("autoprefixer");`

then we add this code to the module of our webpack.config.js file
```js
{
    test: /\.s?css$/,
    use: [
      "style-loader",
      MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
      "css-loader",
      {
        loader: "postcss-loader",
        options: {
          plugins: () => [autoprefixer()],
        },
      },
      "sass-loader",
    ],
  },
```
we also need to enable the MiniCssExtractPlugin in the plugin section of our webpack.config.js file like this.
```js
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin(),
```
sass-loader: The sass-loader is first used to process all .scss files and compiles them to .css files.

postcss-loader: After sass-loader is done converting .scss files to .css files, postcss-loader and autoprefixer is then used to process the .css files and add vendor prefix to the css postcss.

css-loader: The css-loader then helps to return the css in .css files that are imported or required in the project.

style-loader: style-loader takes the css returned by css-loader and inserts it into the page.

MiniCssExtractPlugin: The MiniCssExtractPlugin helps create a separate css file from .css file imports, it is helpful for code splitting.

htmlWebpackPlugin: this plugin helps to automatically generate an index.html file and inserts our JavaScript bundle into the html body. To use the htmlWebpackPlugin, we first import it into our webpack.config.js file like this
`const htmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");`

then enable the plugin in the plugin section by adding this code
```js
new htmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: path.resolve(__dirname, "public", "index.html"),
      favicon: "./public/favicon.ico",
    }),
```
CleanWebpackPlugin: This plugin helps to erase outdated bundle files so it can be replace with the recent file while building. To use this plugin we first import it into our webpack.config.js file like this
const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require("clean-webpack-plugin");

then enable the plugin in the plugin section by adding this code
```js
new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
```
Now we can uncomment the image tag in the Home.vue file and also the scss style in the App.vue file, start our development server and view our project in the browser.
The image above shows our bundle size when we build our project, presently our bundles does not have a random hash which helps with browser cache and we also need to split our code further by creating a vendor chunk and a runtime chunk.

To hash our css bundles, we pass an object
```js
{
filename: "[name].[contenthash:8].css",
chunkFilename: "[name].[contenthash:8].css",
}
```
as params to the MiniCssExtractPlugin.

To hash our files we need to add
```js
name: "[name][contenthash:8].[ext]",
```

to the options object of our file loader.

To hash our bundles we need to add
```js
  filename: "[name].[contenthash:8].js",
  chunkFilename: "[name].[contenthash:8].js",
```

in our webpack output section.

If we build our project now, our bundles would have a random hash.
Code Splitting is an optimization technique used in reducing bundle size into smaller chunks, which helps to reduce the load time of our app. To configure webpack to split our bundle into chunks, we need to add an optimization section to our webpack.config.js file.
```js
  optimization: {
    moduleIds: "hashed",
    runtimeChunk: "single",
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        vendor: {
          test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
          name: "vendors",
          priority: -10,
          chunks: "all",
        },
      },
    },
  }
```
The code above tells webpack to create a runtime chunk, vendor chunk from our node_modules folder, and hash them. Now we should see a runtime bundle and a vendor bundle when we build the project again.

### 6. Final webpack configuration and Observation###
Our final `webpack.config.js` file should look like this
```js
const { VueLoaderPlugin } = require("vue-loader");
const htmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require("mini-css-extract-plugin");
const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require("clean-webpack-plugin");
const autoprefixer = require("autoprefixer");
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    main: "./src/main.js",
  },
  output: {
    filename: "[name].[contenthash:8].js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    chunkFilename: "[name].[contenthash:8].js",
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.vue$/,
        loader: "vue-loader",
      },
      {
        test: /\.(eot|ttf|woff|woff2)(\?\S*)?$/,
        loader: "file-loader",
        options: {
          name: "[name][contenthash:8].[ext]",
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|jpe?g|gif|webm|mp4|svg)$/,
        loader: "file-loader",
        options: {
          name: "[name][contenthash:8].[ext]",
          outputPath: "assets/img",
          esModule: false,
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.s?css$/,
        use: [
          "style-loader",
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          "css-loader",
          {
            loader: "postcss-loader",
            options: {
              plugins: () => [autoprefixer()],
            },
          },
          "sass-loader",
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new VueLoaderPlugin(),
    new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: "[name].[contenthash:8].css",
      chunkFilename: "[name].[contenthash:8].css",
    }),
    new htmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: path.resolve(__dirname, "public", "index.html"),
      favicon: "./public/favicon.ico",
    }),
  ],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      vue$: "vue/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js",
    },
    extensions: ["*", ".js", ".vue", ".json"],
  },
  optimization: {
    moduleIds: "hashed",
    runtimeChunk: "single",
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        vendor: {
          test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
          name: "vendors",
          priority: -10,
          chunks: "all",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  devServer: {
    historyApiFallback: true,
  },
};
```
